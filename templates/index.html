                            We offer one to one mentoring packages for Business Owners, Senior Executives and Managers

                            With over 30 years' experience in business, both as an owner and employee, Kerry Spence
                            understands that leaders often find themselves burdened with multiple responsibilities and
                            often just need a sounding board, a trusted confidant, or the benefit of someone who has
                            experienced and navigated similar challenges to their own.
                            <br>
                            We tailor a mentoring package to suit your timetable and budget - we can schedule sessions
                            as frequently or infrequently as suits you, for as long as it works for you and your
                            business goals.
